# InternshipTask-2
This SQL script is part of Task 2 for the SQL Developer Internship. -- It demonstrates practical use of Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands: -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, handling NULL values, partial inserts, and foreign key constraints.

 This task demonstrates practical DML (Data Manipulation Language) skills in SQL â€” particularly around inserting, updating, deleting, and handling NULLs and constraints.
1. Created a students Table

We defined a table with id, name, age, and grade.

id is a primary key.
name is NOT NULL.
grade has a default value 'NA'.

2. Inserted Data

We added multiple types of data:

 Full row: All columns filled.

 Partial row: Some columns left NULL or set to default.

Specific columns: Inserted data only into selected columns.

3. Used SELECT to Create New Table

We created a new table graduated_students using a SELECT query on students where grade is 'A'.
4. Updated Rows

We updated the grade for students where age > 18.
5. Handled NULL Values

  

6. Deleted Rows

    Deleted by ID.

    Deleted using NULL condition.
